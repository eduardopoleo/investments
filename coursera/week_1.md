MAIN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Statement of cash flow
- Better to organize the type of costs than just blindly tallying them
- Operating
  - Transactions related to the providing the good and services
    e.g office rent wages, customers,
- Investing
  - Transactions related to the acquisition or disposal of long lived assets
    e.g a truck
- Financing
  - transaction related to owners an creditors
  e.g bonds, stocks etc

Income statement
Net Income = Revenues - Expenses

- Revenue: All activities that increase owner equity
- Expenses: All "" that reduce owner equity

It uses accrudal accounting
So it does not equal cash since there are some "tricks" such as
amortization, accruded amounts etc.

Balance sheet
- Reports the financial position
- Assets
- Liabilities
- Stockholders equity


BALANCE SHEET
- It ties all the other financial statements together
- It should always be balance it's main formula is
`Assets = Liabilities + Equity`
- Another way of seeing this is:
- `resources = Claims on Resources by Outsiders (debt) + claim of resources by owners (equity)`
- This must always balance. Breaking this down further:

```ruby
# main equation
assets = liabilities + equity

# contributed_capital: stock or money put in by investors by any means
# retained_earning: not spent cash
equity = contributed_capital + retained_earnings

# prior_retained_earnings: retained_earnings at the beginning of the time period
# net_income: accruded bottom line. Does not equal cash necessarily.
# dividends: money pay out to investors as dividends
retained earnings = prior_retained_earnings + net_income - dividends

# revenues: sources of assets appreciation
# expenses: sources of assets devaluation 
net_income = revenues - expenses

# gross division of cash
assets = cash_assets + non_cash_assets
```

ASSETS, LIABILITIES, STOCKHOLDER equity

Assets and liabilities
- Assets and liabilities have similar definitions
- The main difference is who has the obligation of payment.
- 2 main properties:
  - There's an obligation based on a transaction or previous commitment
    - E.g services were delivered but not paid, money is owed to the bank etc
  - The amount and time of payment can be reasonably estimated.

Stockholder equity
- Stocks of different type
- Retained earnings
`re_end = re_beg + net_income - dividends`
